### Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

> REST is an architectural system centered around resources and Hypermedia using HTTP commands. CRUD is a cycle meant to maintain records in a database setting. In its base form, CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands. It is a way of creating, modifying, and deleting information for the user. 
CRUD functions can exist in a REST API, but REST APIs are not limited to CRUD functions. CRUD can operate within a REST architecture, but REST APIs can exist independent of CRUD.

### If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

- Object Modeling- Identify the resources
- Create Model URI's
- Determine Resource Representations
- Assigning HTTP methods 
- More actions! (logging, security, etc.)

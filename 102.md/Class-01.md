My biggest take away from this article was mostly to keep an open mind, look for a learning oppurtunity and life will not disappoint. Don't give up, maybe reassess. And as Craig would say, if it's worth having, it's worth working for.
- Let others inspire me.
- Let criticism be a base to build better from.
- Let problems or obstacles be an oppurtunity to try a different solution.

## JavaScript Object Basics

### How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

An object, in coding terms, is like a box. The only thing you put in this box is specific information or data. For example if you are making a box for personel information maybe you have a piece of paper that has the information you want stored such as first name, last name, birthday, and what their favorite dinosaur is, but you can also have a list of all their favorite foods on there too. Then you put it in the box so that you can reference the information later.

### What are some advantages to creating object literals?

They are easy to reference and work with using simple syntax. They are easier to work with than a bunch of single items or even an array. 

### How do objects differ from arrays?

It's a dfferent referencing system, instead of using an index number you call it something and then reference it by name. 

### Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.

> "...if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation."

### Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

const dog = {

  name: 'Spot',

  age: 2,

  color: 'white with black spots',

  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}

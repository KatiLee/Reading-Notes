What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

    The alt attribute is meant to describt the image it is paired with. Being explicit with the alt is paramont to it's true purpose. If the image doesn't show up, if there is a screen reader, if images are turned off to save bandwith or lessen distractions, or as keywords for the SEO to utilize; these are all reasons why it's helpful to have a well worded alt for ones image. 

How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

    By using the alt tag to give textual descriptions of the image, also by providing a title tag. 

Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

    The figure element is providing a container for all the accoutrement that is associated with the image, including but not limited to img, scr, alt, demensions, and figcaption. It keeps eerything grouped together so even if the image doesn't show up there will still be description and caption kept together and not wandering around the website all willy nilly. 

Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

    The difference between the two starts with how they are created/stored. 'Scalable Vector Graphics' is a way to create an image through using mathmatical equations in the code. While that does make it easily scalable, without loss of quality to said image, it does make it slightly less versatile in use and creation. Also, it can't be used with pictures. 
    While gif's on the other hand (standing for Graphics Interchange Format) only uses photographs. It flips through a set of images in order to create a short animation, sort of like a flip book. With that being said, it does make the file bulky and practically unscalable. 

What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

    Lossless WebP or PNG. I'm not gonna lie, 90% of this article makes no sense to me. It has something to do with what is lost while compressed, and I understand the less loss there is to compress the higher the retention of the quality which matters most regarding text, which can become blurry if the quality falls low enough.

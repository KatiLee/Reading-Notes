## Getting Started with JavaScript

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.



2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

Basically what ends up happening is the website needs a higherarchy in regards of what to read first. The HTML gets called first since it is the frame work but also it contains within the call to CSS, then when the call is answered it presents the parsed CSS and at the same time when the JavaScript is called it is answered with the parsed JavaScript.

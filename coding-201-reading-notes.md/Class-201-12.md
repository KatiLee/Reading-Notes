>Chart.js provides a set of frequently used chart types, plugins, and customization options. In addition to a reasonable set of built-in chart types, you can use additional community-maintained chart types . On top of that, itâ€™s possible to combine several chart types into a mixed chart (essentially, blending multiple chart types into one on the same canvas).

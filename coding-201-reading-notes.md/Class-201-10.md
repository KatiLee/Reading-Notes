## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

### Name some key differences between a **Syntax Error** and a **Logic Error.**

* Syntax Errors are spelling errors.
* Logic errors means just bad code, the program ran successfully but provides incorrect results. Logic errors are a lot of times harder to fix since they won't be able to provide an error message.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

In one portion of the salmon cookies lab I had a syntax error, by forgetting to add an 's' to the end of "cookie." But another portion of the code was more difficult to fix when I used two different phrases for something I wanted to be the same function.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Just like everything else, practice with coding will provide the repitition needed to know. Becoming more familiar with the debugging codes will help to locate the issue quicker, and the more practice with the code itself will help to be more accurate when creating the code in the first place. 

## The JavaScript Debugger.

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

### Define what a breakpoint is.

### What is the call stack?



### **I wish I knew more about:**

* Why is it that markdown has an issue with a period in a header being a 'trailing puncuation' but a question mark is acceptable?

## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

### How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

'useReducer' helps manage state by using a reducer function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state based on the action. It's useful when the state has complex logic or when multiple components need to interact with the same state.

'useContext' allows you to share data between components without passing props down through all levels of the component tree. By combining 'useReducer' and 'useContext', you can create a central state management system. The reducer function and state can be defined in a context provider component, which makes the state available to child components.

By using these hooks together, you can simplify state management by centralizing and organizing the state logic, making it easier to understand and maintain. It also reduces the coupling between components and promotes cleaner code.

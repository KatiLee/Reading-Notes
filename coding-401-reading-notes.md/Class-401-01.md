## Additional Questions

- Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, 
What do you look forward to learning?

I am curious about what the AWS is all about, since this class isn't the first time I've heard about it. I'm nervously excited to see what all the white board entails. Lastly, I didn't really understand what the bearer auth was when we went through it in 301, just that it was needed, so it's good to see that we will be going over that in more depth.


- What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

I'm mostly just excited about getting back into the thick of it again. I'm hoping that the previous material we worked on in 301 comes back enough that the review builds a good foundation to support the next ten weeks.

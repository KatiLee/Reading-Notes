## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I have great support skills, I can help to make teammates feel supported, heard and validated. This also helps with communication and keeping everybody on the same page to make work flow more effective and efficent. 

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- ::kicks dirt:: Ask for help instead of being stubborn. 

- Taking a break, even if it's just getting up to walk around my house, anything to disengage for five or ten minutes.

- Trying to explain the problem to a friend or my rubber duck, taking the problem to the most bite sized pieces possible.

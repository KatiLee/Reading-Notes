## Web Sockets

### What is a Web Socket?

A web socket is like a special telephone line that allows instant and ongoing communication between your web browser and a server. It's used for real-time updates, making websites and apps feel dynamic and interactive.

### Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.

In summary, the WebSocket request/response handshake is the initial process where the client and the server agree to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket. Once the connection is established, both parties can freely send messages back and forth in real-time, creating a persistent and interactive communication channel.

### Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

## Socket.io Tutorial

### What does the event handler io.on() do?

 `io.on()` in Socket.IO is used to handle incoming events from clients by setting up event listeners on the server side.

### Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected

connection establishment, event handling, broadcasting, error handling, scalabilty, logging and debugging.

### What does socket.emit() do?

`socket.emit()` is used to send events and data from the serer to a specific client, allowing for targeted communication between the server and the individual clients.

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets

### What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

WebSocket is a protocol for real-time communication, while Socket.IO is a library that simplifies and enhances WebSocket usage by providing additional features, cross-browser compatibility, and flexibility in choosing communication mechanisms. 

### When would you use Socket.IO?

Socket.IO is a library that builds upon WebSocket and provides additional features and enhancements. It abstracts the WebSocket protocol and offers a more robust and flexible API for real-time communication.

### When would you use WebSockets?

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides a standardized way for real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server over a single TCP connection.

## TCP Handshakes Explained

### Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend

There's a reason they call it a TCP 'handshake', the client reaches their hand out asking for syncronyzation, the server reaches back with a synchronization acknowledgement as there extended hand. When their hands connect they have a two way link that can be used both ways. 

# Reflection

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

I'm hoping there is further explaination of pretty much all the topics, since the information that was provided here wasn't very helpful or enlightening.

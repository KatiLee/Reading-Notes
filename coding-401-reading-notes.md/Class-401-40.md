I love the idea of open source software and am so excited to have the time to play around with it more after class is done. It makes me happy to think we'll still have that community that will help guide through continual growth, even after class is over. There are a lot of book marks I'm going to go back through and re-assess, but I have a feeling these are going to be some of the most used, and re-used, and important for life long learning going forward.

### Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

Serverless is a way of building websites or apps without worrying about servers. You focus on writing code, and a service provider takes care of running your code whenever it's needed. It scales automatically based on usage, so you don't have to manage server capacity. It's cost-effective because you only pay for what you use, and it makes deployment and updates easier. You can focus on the creative part while someone else handles the technical stuff.

## CDN

### What is a CDN?

A *Content Delivery Network* is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

### How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

When you visit a website, your request is sent to a CDN.

The CDN has servers located in different places around the world. It finds the server that is closest to you.

If the website content you requested is already stored on that nearby server, the CDN quickly gives it to you from there. This makes the content load faster because it doesn't have to travel far.

If the content isn't on the nearby server, the CDN gets it from the main website server and saves a copy of it on the nearby server for future visitors.

The CDN then sends the content back to your computer, and your web browser shows you the website or the requested content.

### What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

A CDN helps websites show their content to visitors faster by keeping copies of the content in different places and giving it to visitors from the closest location. This makes websites load quickly and improves the overall browsing experience.

## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

### What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

> Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. 
> Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file.

### Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

An admin or a manager might be able to see everything and do everything, implying they have full CRUD capabilities. 
While a simple employee might only have read capabilities, or maybe also post, to be able to clock in. 

### What are the Benefits of RBAC?

- Reducing administrative work and IT support
- Maximizing operational efficiency
- Improving compliance

### Compare and Contrast the following two Libraries and the following questions. Yes, they are similarly named.

## react-cookie library

## react-cookies component

### Describe some react-cookie features.

> - Cookie Management: react-cookie provides functions and hooks to manage cookies in your React application. You can create, read, update, and delete cookies easily using the provided APIs.

> - Cross-browser Support: The library handles the differences in cookie management across various browsers, ensuring consistent behavior and compatibility.

> - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support: react-cookie is designed to work well with server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks such as Next.js. It allows you to access and manipulate cookies both on the server-side and client-side seamlessly.

> - Simple API: The library offers a straightforward and intuitive API, making it easy to use and understand. It exports functions like useCookies, withCookies, and CookiesProvider, which can be used to interact with cookies in your React components.

> - Typescript Support: react-cookie provides TypeScript typings, allowing you to leverage the benefits of static type checking and improved development experience if you're using TypeScript in your project.

> - Lightweight: The library aims to be minimalistic and lightweight, keeping the package size small and avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

### Describe some react-cookies features.

> - Cookie Management: react-cookies provides functions to manage cookies in your React application. You can easily load, save, remove, and select cookies using the provided APIs.

> - Cross-browser Support: The library handles the variations in cookie handling across different browsers, ensuring consistent behavior and compatibility.

> - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support: react-cookies is designed to work well with server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks such as Next.js. It allows you to access and manipulate cookies both on the server-side and client-side seamlessly.

> - Simple API: The library offers a straightforward API for cookie management. It provides functions like load, save, remove, and select that can be used to interact with cookies in your React components.

> - Typescript Support: react-cookies provides TypeScript typings, allowing you to leverage the benefits of static type checking and improved development experience if you're using TypeScript in your project.

> - Lightweight: The library aims to be lightweight and does not have any additional dependencies, keeping the package size minimal.

### Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?

I think I would prefer to use react-cookies. It exports functions directly without using hooks, provides simplistically named functions like load, save, remove, and select, it also offers additional features and functionality for managing cookies. While this does mean that the package size is slightly larger, it's still not that big. 

**I did have to use chatGPT to help answer the questions in the last half, as the documentation lent little to no help in regards to differences between the two libraries.**

## AWS SQS vs SNS

### What is the difference betweeen SQS and SNS?

SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a distributed publish-subscribe service.

SQS (Simple Queue Service) is distributed queuing service.

Differences:
- Entity type (pub/sub vs queue)
- Message consumption (push vs pull)
- Persistence (none vs 1 minute-14 days)
- Consumer type (all different vs all the same)

### What are some use cases for both SNS and SQS?

>Choose SNS if:

>You would like to be able to publish and consume batches of messages.
You would like to allow same message to be processed in multiple ways.
Multiple subscribers are needed.

>Choose SQS if:

>You need a simple queue with no particular additional requirements.
Decoupling two applications and allowing parallel asynchronous processing.
Only one subscriber is needed.

## AWS SNS and SQS

### Describe how to use SQS and SNS in a “fanout” pattern.

> The Fanout scenario is when a message published to an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing.

### Explain how “push notifications” work, using SNS.

>With Amazon SNS, you have the ability to send push notification messages directly to apps on mobile devices. Push notification messages sent to a mobile endpoint can appear in the mobile app as message alerts, badge updates, or even sound alerts.

## SQS and SNS Basics

### How might a large scale, distributed application make use of a Queue system like SQS?

In a big application with many parts working together, a queue system like SQS helps by:

- Allowing different parts to talk to each other without knowing about each other directly.
- Spreading out the work evenly so that no part gets overloaded.
- Handling tasks that take a long time or need extra resources.
- Keeping messages safe, even if something goes wrong.
Handling lots of messages when the application gets really busy.

Overall, using SQS helps make the application work better together, handle more work, and keep things running smoothly.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

This all seems really complicated, I'm just hoping to be able to hold on.
